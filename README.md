# 0x00 Introduce

## Tool introduction

Kunyu (kunyu), whose name is taken from <Knuyu Wanguo Quantu>, is actually a professional subject related to geographic information, which counts the geographic information of the sea, land, and sky. The same applies to cyberspace. The same is true for discovering unknown and fragile assets. It is more like a cyberspace map, which is used to comprehensively describe and display cyberspace assets, various elements of cyberspace and the relationship between elements, as well as cyberspace and real space. The mapping relationship. So I think "Kun Yu" still fits this concept.

Kunyu aims to make corporate asset collection more efficient and enable more security-related practitioners to understand and use cyberspace surveying and mapping technology. 

## Application scenario

For the use of kunyu, there can be many application scenarios, such as:

* Forgotten and isolated assets in the enterprise are identified and added to security management.
* Perform quick investigation and statistics on externally exposed assets of the enterprise.
* Red and blue are used against related requirements, and batch inspections of captured IPs are performed.
* Collect vulnerable assets in batches (0day/1day) for equipment and terminals within the impact.
* Information on sites involved in new-type cybercrime cases is quickly collected and merged for more efficient research, judgment, and analysis.
* Statistic and reproduce the fragile assets on the Internet that are affected by related vulnerabilities.

# 0x01 Install

**Need Python3 or higher support**

```
git clone https://github.com/knownsec/Kunyu.git
cd Kunyu
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Linux:
	python3 setup.py install
	kunyu console

Windows:
	cd kunyu
	python3 console.py

PYPI:
	pip3 install kunyu
	
P.S. Windows also supports python3 setup.py install.
```

# 0x02 Configuration instructions
When you run the program for the first time, you can initialize by entering the following command. Other login methods are provided. However, it is recommended to use the API method. Because the user name/password login requires an additional request, the API method is theoretically more efficient. 
```
kunyu init --apikey <your zoomeye key> --seebug <your seebug key>
```
![](./images/setinfo.png)

The first time you use it, you need to use the ZoomEye login credentials to use this tool to collect information.Currently, ZoomEye registered users are given 1w query quota every month, which is enough for daily work.

ZoomEye access address: https://www.zoomeye.org/

Seebug access address: https://www.seebug.org/

The output file path can be customized by the following command,The default output path is: C:/Users/active user/kunyu/output/  or /active user/kunyu/output

```
kunyu init --output C:\Users\风起\kunyu\output

**Settings to change default output fields**

```
Set fields = ip,port
```

![](./images/fields.png)

**Batch IP search**

![](./images/searchbatch.png)

**Icon Search**

When collecting corporate assets, we can use this method to retrieve the same ico icon assets, which usually has a good effect when associating related corporate assets. But it should be noted that if some sites also use this ico icon, irrelevant assets may be associated (but people who are bored with other people's ico icons are always in the minority). Support url or local file search. 

**Command format:** 

```
SearchIocn https://www.baidu.com/favicon.ico 
SearchIcon /root/favicon.ico 
```

![](./images/searchico.png)

**SSL certificate search**

Query through the serial number of the SSL certificate, so that the associated assets are more accurate, and services that use the same certificate can be searched. When you encounter an https site, you can use this method.

![](./images/searchcert.png)

**Multi-factor query**

Similarly, Kunyu also supports multi-factor conditional query related assets, which can be realized through ZoomEye logic operation syntax.

![](./images/headersearch.png)

**Feature Search**

Through HTTP request packet features or website-related features, the same framework assets can be concatenated more accurately

![](./images/factor.png)

**Associated Domain/Subdomain Search**

Search for associated domain names and subdomains, and query associated domain names by default. You can set **associated domain name/subdomain name** two modes by setting the dtype parameter. 

Command format: **SearchDomain Domain** 

![](./images/searchdomain.png)

**Set the type of data to be obtained**

After the V1.6.1 version, the user can set the data type obtained through the stype parameter to IPV4 or IPV6 to realize the application scenario, and the default parameter is v4.

Command format: **set stype = v6**

![](./images/stype.png)

**View Banner Information** 

The user can view the banner corresponding to the specified serial number through the view command, so as to further analyze the front-end code and Header header, and the user can intercept the banner information for further association matching. 

Command format: **view ID** 

![](./images/view.png)

The user can also view the SSL certificate information of the specified serial number through the views command, and further associate it by extracting the sensitive information in the SLL certificate information.

Command format: **views ID**

![](./images/views.png)

**Cscan Scans port information about cobaltStrike**

Cscan, a new feature in Kunyu version 1.7.2, allows you to use this command to identify whether a network asset is cobaltStrike and to enumerate configuration file details.

**Command format:**

```
Cscan 1.1.1.1 443
Cscan 1.1.1.1 443,80
```

![](./images/cscan.png)

**CDNAnalysis（NEW）**

**Command format:**

```
CDNAnalysis --file ip.txt
CDNAnalysis --domain www.baidu.com
```

![](./images/CDNAnalysis.png)

**PupilSearch Sensitive Information Collection**

After Kunyu v1.7.0, the KeyWord command was removed and replaced with PupilSearch, which is the function of extracting sensitive data. Of course, it also supports the extraction of historical banner information through spatial mapping. For example, such as accesskey, the banner in historical data leaks sensitive data. Information, even if the service is changed now, but the AK/SK has not expired, it can still be used directly, understand everything, and support the extraction of sensitive information **(ID number, IP, JWT, API interface, appid, appkey, GithubAccessKey, default username \password, email, etc.)**.

**Command format:**

PupilSearch https://www.domain.com/

PupilSearch ID (extract sensitive information from the banner returned by spatial mapping)

![](./images/pupilsearch_1.png)

![](./images/pupilsearch_2.png)

![](./images/pupilsearch_3.png)

**System command execution** 

After Kunyu v1.6.0, support for the execution of system commands has been added. You can debug surveying and mapping data more conveniently and effectively by executing some commonly used system commands. For a list of specific executable commands, see Article 11 in the Issue of the README file. 

**Example One** 

![](./images/systems.png)

**Example two **

![](./images/system.png)

**Encoding hash calculation**

In some scenarios, you can use this command to perform common HASH encryption/encoding, such as BASE64, MD5, mmh3, HEX encoding, and debug in this way.

**Command format:** 

```
EncodeHash hex 7239dcc9beb5c9cd795415f9
EncodeHash md5 https://www.baidu.com/favicon.ico
EncodeHash md5 /root/favicon.ico
EncodeHash mmh3 https://www.baidu.com/favicon.ico
EncodeHash mmh3 /root/favicon.ico
EncodeHash base64 dasdasdsa
```

![](./images/encode.png)

**Asset Survival Scan**

After Kunyu V1.6.5, the survivability scan of the last retrieval result is added, and the result is output in real time by polling.

![](./images/alivescan.png)

**Seebug vulnerability query**

You can query historical related vulnerabilities by entering information about the framework and equipment you want to find, but you need to note that only English is supported, and improvements and upgrades will be made later.

Command format: **Seebug tongda** 

![](./images/seebug.png)

**Load fingerprint file**

Kunyu V1.6.4 adds the function of loading an external fingerprint library. Kunyu provides 5 fingerprint files as a reference by default. Users can write their own fingerprint files to load or share, and retrieve them more flexibly, which is convenient for traceability and security. Resource sharing in research and red team offense and defense, enhance teamwork.

You can view the information of the currently loaded fingerprint library through the **show rule** command.

![](./images/rule.png)

The default read fingerprint file directory is under **project directory/kunyu/rule**, you can customize the read fingerprint file path setting through **kunyu init --rule C:\风起\rule**.

You can use the **show config** command to view the information of the Kunyu configuration file.

![](./images/showconfig.png)

When faced with complex fingerprint information, you can generate a yaml file through **project directory/kunyu/createrule.py**

![](./images/createrule.png)

The format of the yaml fingerprint file is as follows. Please note that the following standard format must be strictly followed, and no fields are missing.

```bash

```

**Setting parameters**

When set page = 2, the returned results are 40. You can modify the page parameter to set the number of pages to be queried. Note that 1 page = 20/items. You can modify the value according to your needs to get more returned results. 

The configurable parameters and the current values of the parameters are displayed through show. 

![](./images/show.png)

![](./images/set.png)

**Pocsuite linkage**

In versions after v1.3.1, you can use kunyu to link the console mode of pocsuite3 for integrated use.

![](./images/pocsuite.png)

**HOSTS head collision**

Through HOSTS collision, the hidden assets in the intranet can be effectively collided. According to the ServerName domain name and IP configured in the middleware httpf.conf, the access can be directly connected to the intranet business system! Follow-up by setting the local hosts file to achieve local DNS resolution, because the priority of the local hosts file is higher than the DNS server resolution. Support reverse check through ZoomEye domain name library or read TXT file to get the list of domain names. 

**Command format:** 

```
HostCrash C:\ip.txt C:\host.txt 
HostCrash C:\ip.txt baidu.com 
HostCrash 1.1.1.1 baidu.com 
HostCrash 1.1.1.1 G:\host.txt 
```

**Serverless HostCrash Scan**

Kunyu v1.6.2 adds an interesting feature that combines the cloud function to perform HOSTS collisions on the target. In this way, our scanned IP is effectively hidden to prevent it from being captured by the target situational awareness, and it also prevents WAF from banning the real IP. , And conceal the features. Through the following scanning effect, it can be found that the scanned IPs are all cloud service vendors and each scan is a random IP address. You can choose whether to enable it by configuring the cloud function address during initialization.

**Asset distribution map**

v1.6.2 adds the CreateMap command, which can generate a geographic location distribution map for the assets retrieved last time, and more vividly describe the mapping relationship between network space and real space. It is located in the same output directory as Excel, and the generated asset map is the same as the last time. The number of search results is related.

**Data result**

All search results are saved in the user's root directory, and the directory is created based on the current timestamp. All query results of a single start are stored in an Excel format under one directory, giving a more intuitive experience. The output path can be returned through the ExportPath command.

​    In fact, there are still many ideas, but as an Alpha version, this is the case, and it will continue to be improved in the later period. I hope that Kunyu can be known to more security practitioners. Thank you for your support.

​    The tool framework has reference to Kunlun Mirror and Pocsuite3, which are all very good works.

# 0x05 Issue

**1. Multi-factor search**

ZoomEye search can use multi-factor search, dork: cisco +port:80 (note the space) can search for all data that meets the cisco and port:80 conditions. If there is no space in the middle, it is the same search condition, that is, all data that meets cisco and port 80. Kunyu's dork does not need quotation marks, **The new version 2.0 syntax has changed. **

**2. High-precision geographic location**

ZoomEye gives privileged users high-precision geographic location data, but it should be noted that ordinary users do not have this function, please be aware.

**3. Username/password login**

If you use username/password as the initialization condition, the token obtained will be valid for 12 hours. If you find that your search cannot return data, you may as well info it. If the session times out, the initialization command prompt will be returned. In most cases, we recommend that you use the API KEY method, and there will be no expiration problem. This design is also for the security of your account and password. After all, the API KEY can be reset and the token will become invalid, but with the account and password, it is possible to log in to your ZoomEye account.

**4. Cert certificate search**

It should be noted that according to conventional logic, you need to encode the serial number of the target SSL certificate in hexadecimal before searching with the statement, but Kunyu only needs to provide the Domain address to search. The principle is to make a request to the target station to obtain the serial number and process it, but if your host cannot access the target to be searched, it cannot be retrieved. At this time, you can also use the conventional method to search with the statement.

**5. Favicon icon search**

ico icon search supports both URL search and local ico icon file search, which has better scalability and compatibility.

**6. Query data storage path**

By default, your query data is in the Kunyu folder under the user directory. You can also use the ExportPath command in console mode to query the path.

**7. Auto-completion**

Kunyu's auto-completion supports uppercase and lowercase letters, command records, etc. Use Tab to complete. For usage, please refer to Metasploit.

**8. About the error when using pip install kunyu**

When using pip install kunyu, the following error is reported:
`File "C:\Users\风起\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts\kunyu-script.py", line 1 SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xb7' in file C:\Users\风起\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts\kunyu-script.py on line 1, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details`

Solution:
Modify the C:\Users\风起\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts\kunyu-script.py file and add # encoding: utf-8 at the beginning of the file
Then save it and it can be used normally. The reason for this bug is that there is a Chinese name in the user directory path, which usually appears on Windows.

**9. Pocsuite3 module POC storage directory**

When using the pocsuite3 module, if you want to add a new POC module, you can add the POC file in **project directory/pocsuite3/pocs/**. It should be noted that when using the packaged Kunyu console command, the POC should be added to the directory, and the kunyu program should be repackaged to load the POC normally.

**10. Pocsuite3 module POC missing problem**

When using the Pocsuite command linkage, if it is a packaged Kunyu version, the poc has been fixed. At this time, modifying the poc directory cannot add a new module. At this time, you can repackage it or use **project directory/kunyu/console.py** to run kunyu to update the poc module in real time.

**11. Kunyu executable system commands are as follows. **

**Windows:**
OS_SYSTEM = [**"ipconfig", "dir", "whoami", "ping", "telnet", "cd", "findstr", "chdir","find", "mysql", "type", "curl", "netstat", "tasklist", "taskkill", "tracert", "del", "ver","nmap","ls"**]

**Linux/Mac:**

 OS_SYSTEM = [**"ifconfig", "ls", "cat", "pwd", "whoami", "ping", "find", "grep", "telnet", "mysql", "cd", "vi", "more", "less", "curl", "ps", "netstat", "rm", "touch", "mkdir", "uname","nmap"**]

**12. Kunyu operating environment**

It is recommended to use Python3.2 - 3.12. Other versions of Python3 may have unknown errors. **Python2 cannot be used**.

**13. Set timeout**

If the HTTP request is not responded to in time, you can solve it by increasing the timeout time, such as: set timeout = 50

**14. Kunyu client startup time is long**

Since Kunyu2.0 will identify and use domestic and foreign interfaces during the initialization phase, it may take a while to start and use, the time is 5-10 seconds.

**15. RULE fingerprint storage location**

The RULE fingerprint storage location can be configured and modified under ~/.kunyu.ini, and the default is under the compiled and run kunyu path.

**16. View function cannot be used**

The view function is in the ZoomEye update, and the business version membership is required to use it normally. The views function is not affected.

**17. Abnormal BUG**

Since the test environment is MAC OS, there may be incompatibility issues in other operating systems. Please feedback the ISSUE or contact the operation in time.

**18. Antivirus software check**

Kunyu may fail to start due to antivirus software checking files, please pay attention to this problem

**19. I haven't decided yet ^_^**
